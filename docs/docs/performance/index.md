# Performance Considerations

Performance is a critical aspect of any rule engine, and Bonsai is designed with performance in mind. This section covers various performance considerations and optimization techniques for Bonsai.

## Topics Covered

- [Optimizing Tree Structure](optimizing-tree-structure.md): Learn how to design efficient tree structures
- [Memory and Compute](memory-compute.md): Understand memory and compute considerations

## Performance Characteristics

Bonsai's performance characteristics depend on several factors:

- **Tree Depth**: The depth of the tree affects traversal time
- **Number of Edges**: The number of edges per knot affects evaluation time
- **Filter Complexity**: The complexity of filter conditions affects evaluation time
- **Context Size**: The size of the context data affects evaluation time
- **Storage Implementation**: The performance of the storage implementation affects operation time

## General Performance Tips

Here are some general tips for optimizing Bonsai performance:

### Design Efficient Trees

- **Keep trees shallow**: Minimize the depth of your trees to reduce traversal time
- **Limit the number of edges**: Keep the number of edges per knot reasonable
- **Order edges effectively**: Put the most likely matches first to reduce the number of evaluations
- **Use simple filters**: Keep filter conditions simple and focused
- **Avoid complex JsonPath expressions**: Complex expressions can be expensive to evaluate

### Optimize Storage

- **Use in-memory storage for read-heavy workloads**: In-memory storage provides the best read performance
- **Implement caching**: Cache frequently accessed knots and edges
- **Use efficient serialization**: Choose an efficient serialization format for persistent storage
- **Consider read/write separation**: Use separate instances for read and write operations

### Optimize Context

- **Keep context data small**: Include only the necessary data in the context
- **Use custom context implementations**: Implement custom context classes for specific use cases
- **Consider caching context evaluation results**: Cache the results of expensive evaluations

### Optimize Evaluation

- **Use contextual preferences for frequently accessed keys**: Bypass tree traversal for frequently accessed keys
- **Batch evaluations**: Evaluate multiple keys in a single operation when possible
- **Implement result caching**: Cache evaluation results for frequently used key-context combinations

## Monitoring and Profiling

To identify performance bottlenecks, consider:

- **Instrumenting your code**: Add timing metrics to key operations
- **Using profiling tools**: Use profiling tools to identify hotspots
- **Monitoring memory usage**: Track memory usage to identify potential issues
- **Logging performance metrics**: Log performance metrics for analysis

## Scaling Considerations

For high-throughput applications, consider:

- **Horizontal scaling**: Deploy multiple instances of your application
- **Vertical scaling**: Increase the resources available to your application
- **Caching**: Implement caching at various levels
- **Asynchronous processing**: Use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
