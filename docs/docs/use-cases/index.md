- [Dynamic Pricing Rules](dynamic-pricing.md): Explore how to create complex pricing rules with nested conditions

## Why Use Bonsai for These Use Cases?

Bonsai offers several advantages for implementing these use cases:

- **Flexibility**: Bonsai's tree-based structure can represent complex decision logic
- **Dynamic Updates**: Rules can be updated without code changes
- **Conditional Logic**: Conditions can be based on various factors
- **Nested Structures**: Complex hierarchical rules can be represented
- **Performance**: Efficient evaluation for high-throughput scenarios
- **Versioning**: Changes can be tracked and potentially reverted

## Common Patterns

Across these use cases, you'll notice some common patterns:

- **Decision Trees**: Using tree structures to represent decision logic
- **Conditional Branching**: Using conditions to determine which path to follow
- **Default Cases**: Providing fallback options when no conditions match
- **Nested Structures**: Using nested structures to represent complex hierarchies
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updating rules without code changes

## Getting Started

To get started with these use cases, you should first:

1. Understand the basic concepts of Bonsai
2. Set up a Bonsai instance with appropriate configuration
3. Design your tree structure based on your specific requirements
4. Implement the tree structure using Bonsai's API
5. Test your implementation with various inputs
