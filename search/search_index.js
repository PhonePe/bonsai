Rule engines are typically structured as a set of rules that are evaluated against a Context. Bonsai is a data structure that models such engines as a tree of knots and edges.

What started off as a small rule engine for Frontend App configurations, Bonsai as a library powers a large number of use-cases internally in PhonePe. It is either used  directly as a light-weight library, or wrapped in a service that provides a UI to create and manage trees.
